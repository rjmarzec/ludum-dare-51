# Stalwat Planet Guard

Hop around the solar system while keeping those pesky UFO cats at bay! Every 10 seconds another planet spawns for you to hop around between, but so does another wave of cats.

Pick your upgrades wisely, and you might just be able to build out the largest solar system in the galaxy!

Beware: 1 bump from anything cat-related is all they need to take you down. How many planets can you make before you get bested?
